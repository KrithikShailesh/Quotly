# Quotly

A Flutter Application which displays new quotes each and every time it is opened.

## Idea:

We all smile when we read something good, I just wanted to make people feel good and have a smile whenever they opened an app. So I planned on creating a quotes app which will make people have some hope whenever they read a quote from this app.

## Platform:

1. Android Studio
2. Firebase

## Difficuties Faced and Solved:

Initially I kept all my quotes inside a list, but the app size seemed to get bigger each and every time added new quotes to the list.
So I planned to keep all the quotes in a Firebase Database (Firestore) and fetched the quotes from there.

## Plans:

I am in the idea of adding more features to the app thereby making it a complete quotes app.
